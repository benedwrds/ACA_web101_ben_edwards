    Thanks for checking out Patrizi’s! For over 50 years the Patrizi family has been cooking from tried and true recipes
    from the old country. We strive to bring authentic Italian fare to the bustling Austin food scene. With our fresh
    pasta pulled to order, homemade sauces, and friendly atmosphere, Patrizi’s is quickly becoming a favorite among
    Austin’s east side locals. Located adjacent to a performance art venue and bar, the inviting and lively atmosphere
    makes dining with us a unique experience. Come celebrate honest food, true friends and good wine at Patrizi’s family
    owned food truck!
  </p>
  <p>
    We have carefully chosen our ingredients to reflect the traditional flavors the Patrizi family has been cultivating
    for decades. From the simple Roman dish “Cacio e Pepe” to our robust homemade “Patrizi’s Red Sauce” we have a little
    something for everyone! Our staff will happily guide you through our menu and help you find that Italian flavor you
    crave.
  </p>
  <p>
    *To-Go orders: We’re happy to make your order to go, but due to the delicate nature of fresh pasta we do not take
    call-in orders. To minimize the time the cooked pasta spends between the kitchen and your mouth, we suggest ordering
    your food in person and consuming it shortly after!

        <p class="glutenHeader">Gluten Free Options</p>

        <p>
          While we have experimented with gluten free pasta substitutes such as Zucchini, and Spaghetti Squash based
          noodles, we are currently not offering such substitutions. After a myriad of trial and error and countless
          analyses, the kitchen has come to the conclusion that our experiments haven't yielded an adequate gluten free
          stand-in for our freshly made Pasta. Even barring the structural problems a gluten free pasta presents to a
          kitchen covered in flour, our dedication to providing the best quality food is the primary reason for the menu
          change.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, we've focused our efforts on making sure those with dietary concerns can still have a delicious and
          diverse meal with us at Patrizi's in a different format. From off-menu items, to specific meal curation, our
          staff is always happy to help the gluten free, vegan, non-red-meat-eating, and anyone in-between to find their
          perfect meal. From local vegetables, to house made cheeses (vegan and non), and complex salads, we're
          confident
          our servers will give you the best possible experience.
        </p>
        ​<p>
          We will continue to experiment with food that challenges us, and pushes us to create for the sake of the
          community. We hope to have you with us on our way.
